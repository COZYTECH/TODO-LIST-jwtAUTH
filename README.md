âœ… Todo List API (MongoDB + Express.js + JWT Authentication)

This project is a RESTful Todo List API built with Express.js and MongoDB, designed to help users manage daily tasks efficiently and securely. It integrates JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage their tasks.

ðŸ”‘ Features

User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login using JWT.

Task Management (CRUD):

Create new tasks

View all tasks or a single task

Update task details (status, title, description)

Delete tasks

User-Specific Todos: Each user can only manage their own todos.

Data Validation: Middleware ensures clean and valid inputs.

Error Handling: Unified error response for easier debugging.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Express.js â€“ Backend framework for building APIs

MongoDB + Mongoose â€“ NoSQL database for storing todos and user data

JWT (jsonwebtoken) â€“ Secure authentication and authorization

bcrypt â€“ Password hashing for secure credential storage

ðŸ‘‰ This API can serve as the backend for a todo app frontend (React, React Native, etc.) or as a standalone project to demonstrate secure CRUD operations.
